# Bakesite

Simple static site/blog generator for Github pages. 

Write markdown, publish html.

### Yet Another Static Site Generator

While I used both Jekyll, Pelican and Hugo for different iterations of my personal blog, I always felt that the solution to the seemingly simple problem of static site building was over-engineered. 

If you look into the code bases of any other aforementioned projects, understanding, altering or contributing back is a daunting task. 

Why did it have to be so complicated? And how hard could it be to build?

## Acknoledgements

Thanks to a previous project by Sunaina Pai, Makesite, for providing the foundations of this project.
