<!-- title:My WTF's of Twin Peaks Season 1 -->

Twin Peaks, its been on my watch list for a while now. But since listening to the recent episodes on the Black Dahlia murders from [Last Podcast on the Left (Ep. 600)](https://www.lastpodcastontheleft.com/), my desire has only grown.

While strange, mysterious and sometimes goofy, I thought it interesting to post my reactions/thoughts/comments on the episodes as we watch them. 

They are in no particular order. Just some questions or comments from my internal dialogue as we watch through the episodes.

1. Whats with the blue room in the hospital that Deputy Hawk chases the One Armed Man through? 
2. The Log Lady. This must be one of the strangest characters I have seen in television. I couldn't imagine a modern live-action television show having a character like this today. I can't wait to find out what her deal is.
3. Agent Cooper's reactions to great coffee are fantastic.
4. All the dead animals on the wall. There have been at least 8 or 9 scenes where a animal or animal head have been present on the wall. For instance, in both Leo and Horne's office, there is a big fish mounted on the wall. The police station has a deer. 
5. Am I blind? I haven't noticed any actual twin peaks yet...
6. Whats up with the dark spirit in the forest? They mentioned it, and never revisited that theme. Was the dark spirit the guy behind the tree when Bobby and his friend went to pick up drugs from Leo? 
7. Leland dancing all the time. Poor dude. 
8. Maddy Ferguson IS Laura Palmer, right??
