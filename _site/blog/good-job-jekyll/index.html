Good job [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the team around [Jekyll Admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin)!

After lots of time away from writing publically, I have come back to it. Not knowing what platform to use, I tried many different ones. 

**Medium**. A truly disappointing experience to say the least. My biggest gripe: If I contribute content, why should I have to pay to view content?? WTF? It felt like a stab in the back the first time I saw the paywall appear after having published various articles that drew a non-significant "read" rate.

**Ghost**. I was stunned by its elegance and UX. I spun up a self hosted instance in a matter of minutes on DigitalOcean. But for a one person show, its overkill. It seems that it is geared for an organization that can pop out articles every day with different writers each. Think a heavily invested content dominated organization...

**Jekyll**. Tried it years ago. At the time it did it's job. But my biggest overriding complaint at the time was the UX of creating and editing content. All static was a PIA to maintain. Manipulating html, links, etc. Editing and make the print show up for the end user in a readable manner, became a road block to churrning out any creative content. 

Finally, after much deliberation, I decided to try give Jekyll another go around. Especially, after seeing Jekyll Admin, I was sold back onto it. 

It's simple, elegant, easy to deploy, and free to host on Github. 

So to this, I give a round of applause to the teams developing these platforms for us to use free of charge!
