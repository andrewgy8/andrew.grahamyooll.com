<p>It is a common pattern: The technical lead/most senior engineer on the team takes on people management as an afterthought, only later to find out they are no longer doing the things they love, nor leading anyone through the thick spaghetti that software development.</p>
<p>As an engineering manager, your main job is no longer technical leadership, you can now delegate that to someone else closer to the ground. Instead, it's the tricky responsibility of leading a team and watching them efficiently turn out results.</p>
<p>I don't regret the decision, but it has been a paradigm shift for me. People management is not operational leadership, it is tactical leadership.</p>
