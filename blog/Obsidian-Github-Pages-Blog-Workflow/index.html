<h1><a href="/blog/Obsidian-Github-Pages-Blog-Workflow/">My Simple Obsidian to Github Pages Writing Workflow</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2024-11-04 by <b>Andrew Graham-Yooll</b></p>
<p>Writing is hard. But so is publishing your writing. And much like software, publishing is the analog of &quot;going to production&quot; ie. only when your thoughts and writing are in the wild can it really have an impact.</p>
<p>After starting and stopping many articles, only to have dreaded the publishing of the writing, I decided to ditch all the fancy static site generators and go barebones with html and css.</p>
<p>Well... I actually stumbled upon a <a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">simple, no-frills Python script</a> that compiles together markdown files into html.</p>
<p>With this, I'm able to write my blog post in Obsidian, export it to markdown in the blog project, and then publish the blog post to Github. And within 2 min, I have got it published.</p>
<h1>Pros and Cons</h1>
<p>The cost is 0$. All writing happens locally within Obsidian. And the headache of publishing has nearly gone away.<br>
I can imagine in the near future that the script I have will get quite messy. As I add in more edge cases or features, there will need to be some hands-on maintenance of this workflow.</p>
<h1>How Does it Work</h1>
<ol>
<li>Setup a command in Obsidian using the <a href="https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd">QuickAdd plugin</a> which pulls a blog template I have into a blog directory within my Vault.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: My template has <code>&lt;!-- title:My Simple Obsidian to Github Pages Writing Workflow --&gt;</code> in the top for the static site script to work properly.<br>

</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Write what I want in the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/bingryan/obsidian-markdown-export-plugin">Markdown Export plugin</a>, and set the destination to my directory locally which hosts my blog.<br>
<img src="/attachment/aab971c9bb282650d587b484cc8a58e0.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locally, I can serve my blog and make any UI changes to the html.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><s>Once I'm happy with it, I then publish it with <code>git subtree push --prefix _site origin gh-pages</code></s></p>
<p><strong>Edit on 2025-01-22:</strong> I have now enabled a Github action which builds the site and then pushes it to the gh-pages branch where Github then serves the folder. This has greatly simplified the deployment process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can find all the code related to the blog hosting <a href="https://github.com/andrewgy8/my-page">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The blog is work in progress, and Im taking it one post at a time to see how it works out. But if you find it useful, by all means go ahead and use this workflow.</p>
<p>And if you have any questions, feel free to open up an issue and I'll be happy to answer it.</p>
