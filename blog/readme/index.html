<p class="meta">Published on 2016-09-16 by <b>Andrew Graham-Yooll</b></p>
<p><h2 class="section-heading">readme</h2></p>
<p>One of the greatest lessons I have learned in development is to always read the README.</p>
<p>Instead of asking a question on StackOverflow or some forum, I highly suggest reading the README first of the gem, module, and/or package.  Not only will you learn more by doing it, but you will also grasp the important skill any employer looks for...self-motivation.</p>
<p>Any half-way decent software will have a solid README that should take care of most of the functionality and set-up.</p>
<p>With this being said, here is the README for this <a href="https://github.com/andrewgy8/andrewgy8.github.io">site</a>.</p>
<p>#Andrew Graham-Yooll's Blog</p>
<p>A blog/site for hosting his resume.</p>
<p>Built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and a <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/landing-pages/">StartBootstrapTemplate</a>.</p>
<p>Shout out to BlackRockDigital for their fantastic <a href="http://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/">Jekyll Template</a></p>
<h2>My goal(s) with this site</h2>
<p>First, this site is a host for my resume. If I could find an employer to look at it,
that would be swell.</p>
<p>But mainly, this site will serve as a kind of tutorial site for myself first and foremost,
and for others that happen to run upon it. As a fairly new developer, I have had a tough time
learning certain concepts. I hope this blog solidifies my understanding of those aspects of the
trade, and possibly helping other out as well.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I like art. I will be posting my art and other contributors art. Their names and
comments will be posted.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any suggestions, comments or questions, my email is andrewgy8@gmail.com</p>
